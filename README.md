# automated_attendance_using_opencv
Problem Statement:
                 Attendance in colleges and organisation have been a time consuming task.Moreover there are chances of fake attendace of fake attendance and proxy in colleges.In order to avoid these troubles,improve accuracy and to make automated without human intervention,We proposed a solution using computer vision.
                  
Libraries used:
Open source computer vision library using python
PIL-python image library
pyttsx-for audio output of attendance

Process Flow:
The teacher need not want to take the attendance all the process will be done in background.And the attendance result are announced as voice output in every period.The attendace will be automatically updated in the database.

LBPF Face recognizer:
Local binary pattern recognition-Comparing the neighbourhood pixels.Converts the images into a numpy array of pixels and the values are converted into histograms.
